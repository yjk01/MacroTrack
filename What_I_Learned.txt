  By making this macro tracking app, I gained experience in several key areas of Android development. I learned how to effectively use Jetpack Compose to create an user interface, including scrollable lists, user input, and different sections of an app interface. I also explored handling camera functionality, such as capturing and displaying photos, and ensuring proper permissions for cameras but failed to implement it in the app due to errors that caused the emulator to crash. I will definitely take another look into implementing the camera into the app because it will allow the users to upload the photos of their food to the daily cards.

  I also utilized state management in Compose, working with remember and mutableStateOf to track changes in user data. Additionally, I learned a simple way of storing nutrition information and improved my skills in structuring data for an app. Overall, this project allowed me to use Jetpack Compose to not only create ui, but feed logic into an interface. Moving forward, I would like to learn more about accessing the device’s local storage and saving the user input permanently so that the data isn’t wiped every time the app is reloaded.
